<h1>Playwright NUnit C# Test Automation Framework</h1>

Playwright is ASYNC codebase. 

Sync vs. Async
<li> Async is multi-thread, which means operations or programs can run in parallel. Sync is a single-thread, so only one operation or program will run at a time. Async is non-blocking, which means it will send multiple requests to a server. </li>
